Peanut Butter and Jelly, an Overview
***********

A peanut butter and jelly sandwich is the quintessential, love it or hate it staple of American childhood lunches. It is a culture icon. But where did it come from, and what is it really?
In 1901, Julia Davis Chandler wrote in The Boston Cooking School Magazine of Culinary Science and Domestic Economics: "For variety, some day try making little sandwiches, or bread fingers, of three very thin layers of bread and two of fill- ing, one of peanut; paste, whatever brand you prefer, and currant or crab-apple jelly for the other. The combination is delicious, and, so far as I know, original."

Peanut butter is not the only type of "butter" you can use:


Peanut Butter: Traditional, but peanuts are a common allergy.
Sunflower Seed Butter:  Nut-free butter avoids most allergies.
Cashew Butter: Cashew butter is more expensive than peanut butter, but cashews can also be more delicious than peanuts.
